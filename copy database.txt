If you want to transfer database to another system, then you must use the following commands.

First copy the database to the output directory.
Do not start mongo, just run the command straight in the console(mongod must be running, though):

mongodump --db DatabaseName -o ./DirectoryName

then copy that directory and put it into your machine and issue this command:

(mongod must running)
if an old copy already exists, drop it first -> db.dropDatabase()
then copy:
mongorestore --db DBName ./DirectoryName
